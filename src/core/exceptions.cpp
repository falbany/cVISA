 * This file is part of the cvisa library.
 * It is intentionally left empty as the exception classes are fully defined
 * in the corresponding header file (Exceptions.hpp). This file is included

 * for completeness and to support build systems that require a source file
 * for every header.

// No implementation needed here as all methods are defined in the header.
